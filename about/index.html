            About Me
        </h1>
    
        <p>
            I'm Andre Fu, a second year Chemical Engineering student at the University of Toronto. I'm passionate about a lot of things, from bioinformatics to aviation!
        </p>

        <p>
            I'm always trying to learn new skills, techniques and hobbies to improve myself. I love to learn which makes me good at general knowledge!
            I started this site to showcase my projects and to document my progress in software engineering. I'm hoping that I can share some of my experiences with programming
            and help other people with their code!
        </p>

        <p>
            I'm most proficient in Python so most of my projects are built in Python. I also know C, C++, MATLAB, LaTeX!
        </p>
